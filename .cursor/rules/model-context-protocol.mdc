# model-context-protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation (Importance Score: 75) defines core interaction patterns for AI model communication and context management.

Key Components:

1. Prompt Template System
Path: src/agentor/mcp/api_router.py
- Custom prompt template engine for dynamic message construction
- JSON-RPC routing for standardized model interactions
- Capability discovery and registration for available model functions
- Context-aware template selection based on conversation state

2. Resource Management
Path: src/agentor/mcp/api_router.py
- Tool capability mapping and validation
- Dynamic resource allocation for model interactions
- Context preservation across model calls
- Specialized JSON-RPC method handling

Core Business Rules:
- AI model interactions must follow standardized MCP format
- Each model request requires valid capability declarations
- Context must be preserved across multiple model interactions
- Templates dynamically adapt based on conversation state

The system implements a custom approach to managing AI model interactions while maintaining consistent context and ensuring proper resource allocation across different model capabilities.
