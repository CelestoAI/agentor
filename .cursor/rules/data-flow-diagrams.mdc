## Core Data Flow Components

### Agent Hub Data Routing (src/agentor/agenthub/main.py)
- Hierarchical data flow between specialized agents:
  - Research requests -> Concept research agent
  - Code generation -> Coder agent 
  - Email/Calendar operations -> Google integration agent
- Task delegation flow with context preservation
Importance Score: 85/100

### Google Integration Data Flow (src/agentor/agenthub/google/google_agent.py)
- Privacy-filtered data pipeline for Gmail and Calendar access
- Context-aware filtering of sensitive data
- Consent-gated information retrieval flow
Importance Score: 90/100

### Memory Management Flow (src/agentor/memory/api.py)
- Conversation data ingestion -> Vector embedding -> Storage pipeline
- Semantic search retrieval flow with context retention
- Bi-directional conversation context updates
Importance Score: 80/100

## Key Information Flows

### Authentication Pipeline
1. User Request -> OAuth2 Flow -> Credential Storage
2. Credential Refresh -> Permission Validation -> Access Grant
3. Context Preservation -> Agent Access Control
Importance Score: 85/100

### Multi-Agent Communication Flow
1. Request Entry -> Agent Hub Router
2. Specialized Agent Selection -> Task Distribution
3. Inter-Agent Data Exchange -> Response Aggregation
Importance Score: 80/100

### Output Processing Pipeline (src/agentor/output_text_formatter.py)
1. Agent Output -> Event Stream Processing
2. Tool Action Formatting -> Response Assembly
3. Multi-Agent Response Coordination
Importance Score: 75/100
