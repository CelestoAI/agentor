# memory-system-architecture

## Core Memory Components

The memory system architecture implements specialized conversation storage and retrieval through vector databases and semantic search capabilities.

### Vector Database Implementation (src/agentor/memory/api.py)
- Custom schema for storing conversation embeddings
- Semantic search implementation using sentence transformers
- Conversation context retention logic
Importance Score: 85/100

### Memory Management System
Core functionalities:
- Conversation history maintenance with embeddings
- Context-aware semantic search over past conversations
- Integration with vector storage (LanceDB)
Importance Score: 80/100

## Business Workflows

### Conversation Context Management
- Implements conversation storage with semantic understanding
- Handles context retention across multiple interactions
- Maintains hierarchical conversation structure
Importance Score: 75/100

### Memory Access Patterns
- Custom memory agent instructions for retrieval operations
- Domain-specific memory search and update workflows
- Conversation embedding processes
Importance Score: 70/100

## Integration Points

### Semantic Search Integration
- Specialized query processing for conversation retrieval
- Context-aware filtering of memory results
- Custom response formatting for memory lookups
Importance Score: 80/100

Overall Memory System Importance Score: 80/100
