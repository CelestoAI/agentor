# agent-orchestration-system

The agent orchestration system implements a multi-agent collaboration framework with specialized roles and dynamic task routing.

Core Components:

## Specialized Agent Types
Path: src/agentor/agenthub/main.py

- Concept Research Agent
  - Handles topic exploration and knowledge gathering
  - Maintains research context across multiple queries
  
- Coder Agent
  - Implements code based on specifications
  - Manages code versioning and iterations

- Google Integration Agent
  - Provides Gmail/Calendar access
  - Handles specialized privacy controls
  - Manages authentication flows

Importance Score: 85

## Agent Initialization System
- Dynamic lazy loading of agent capabilities
- Contextual initialization based on task requirements
- Resource allocation based on agent specialization

## Inter-Agent Communication
- Task handoff protocol between specialized agents
- Context preservation during agent transitions
- Capability-based routing logic

## Orchestration Logic
- Dynamic agent selection based on task context
- Cross-agent memory sharing and context synchronization 
- Multi-step task decomposition and delegation

The system focuses on maintaining coherent task execution across multiple specialized agents while preserving context and ensuring appropriate handoffs based on agent capabilities.
