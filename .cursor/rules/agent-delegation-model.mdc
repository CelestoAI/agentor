# agent-delegation-model

The agent delegation model implements a hierarchical system for coordinating specialized AI agents and routing tasks between them.

## Core Components

### Agent Hub (src/agentor/agenthub/main.py)
Implements the primary agent delegation hierarchy:
- Concept research agent for research tasks
- Coder agent for programming tasks  
- Google integration agent for email/calendar operations
Importance Score: 85/100

### Agent Delegation Router (src/agentor/agents.py)
Manages inter-agent communication and task routing:
- Routes requests to specialized agents based on task type
- Handles agent-to-agent handoffs and context sharing
- Manages tool access permissions between agents
Importance Score: 80/100

### Specialized Agent Integration (src/agentor/agenthub/google/google_agent.py) 
Privacy-aware integration agent:
- Handles Gmail and Calendar operations
- Implements context-aware data filtering
- Requires explicit user consent for sensitive operations
Importance Score: 90/100

## Key Workflows

### Task Routing
- Hierarchical event processing for multi-agent interactions
- Tool action routing based on agent specializations
- Streaming event handling for agent outputs
Importance Score: 75/100

### Agent Coordination
- Inter-agent communication patterns
- Context sharing between specialized agents
- Hierarchical decision making for task delegation
Importance Score: 80/100
