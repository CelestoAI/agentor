# data-flow-models

The system implements several key data flow patterns across its components:

1. Agent Handoff Protocol (Importance Score: 85)
Path: src/agentor/agenthub/main.py
- Contextual task routing between specialized agents
- Dynamic state transfer during agent transitions
- Shared memory context preservation during handoffs
- Task-specific agent initialization based on workflow requirements

2. Memory Operations Flow (Importance Score: 75)
Path: src/agentor/memory/api.py
- Vector-based conversation storage and retrieval pipeline
- Semantic search data routing through LanceDB
- Versioned conversation context propagation
- Memory embedding workflow with custom schema

3. Tool Integration Flow (Importance Score: 70)
Path: src/agentor/tools/registry.py
- Tool capability discovery and routing system
- Dynamic registration of tool endpoints
- Context-aware tool execution pipeline
- External provider integration flow (Celesto)

4. Google Service Data Flow (Importance Score: 80)
Path: src/agentor/agenthub/google/google_agent.py
- Email processing and calendar operation workflows
- Privacy-aware data routing mechanisms
- Authentication state management
- Context-preserving service integration

5. Model Context Protocol Flow (Importance Score: 75)
Path: src/agentor/mcp/api_router.py
- JSON-RPC based model interaction pipeline
- Tool capability routing system
- Dynamic prompt template flow
- Resource management workflow

Key Integration Points:
- Agent-to-Memory flow for context preservation
- Tool-to-Agent communication patterns
- Memory-to-Model context propagation
- Service-to-Agent data routing
